### About
A payment system capable of automatically detecting and transferring any ERC-20 tokens in any EVM chain from the user's wallet.  
The project removes the need to pay for the purchase with a certain token. He doesn't need to swap or bridge token.  
The system itself will find a token from the user, which is enough for payment, or divide the payment into several tokens.  
The buyer only needs to confirm the transaction for payment, and he can also choose a certain token for payment himself.  
Now the project is able to accept 100 tokens in 5 networks, the system is easily scalable to other networks and tokens.  

### I developed
- Parsing and saving top tokens of network 
- Finding wallet's tokens
- Building payment transaction chain 
- Demo react app
